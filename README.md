# wi-ck
An easy to use tool for automating aircrack-ng  
wi-ck stands for wifi-crack (like wireless-fidelity, you get it ;) )  
usage: wi-ck [path to dump]  
       wi-ck -c [path to cap file]
  
## Features:
- Automatically turns on the wireless interface and starts dumping handshakes and list of APs and probes
- Stop the monitor interface
- Crack the capture file
- Makes your life easier(if you are a hacker)

## Changelog:
v(0.0.1): added a default dumping path to /tmp/crack so now you just have to type 'wi-ck' and it does everything by itself
